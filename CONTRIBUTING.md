# Thank you for considering contribution to the **WD-Bridge** project
### Issues
Before creating new issues please take a look at the already open issues, and see if there's one that matches your own issue.  
If not you are welcome to open a new one, and I will try to respond and fix as soon as possible.  
If there's an already existing issue, you can comment on it, to signal the importance of the issue.  
Issues don't have to be problems necessarily, they can be questions and feature requests also.  
So don't hesitate to open one, if you have a suggestion/question/problem with the project.  
The name of the issue should be descriptive and short if possilbe, you can write the details in the desription field.  
### Pull Requests
If you decided to write a fix/feature for the project, you can open a new pull request.  
I'll try to respond as soon as possible, but I also have to make sure the changes don't break something in the current code/implementations.  
Pull requests are always welcome, don't hesitate to open one.  
If there are problems with you PR we can work together to solve the issue and merge the changes.  
The name of the PR should be short (if possible) and reflect the changes made to the code.  
### Code of Conduct
Before opening a new issue or PR you should read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sbencoding/WD-Bridge/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and change your wording if necessary.
